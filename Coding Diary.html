    This website is meant to be a coding practice simulator for my HTML Skills.
I would like to Have gone really far in one computer language before the beginning
of my next term. Further down this website I shall highlight what i've learnt so far 
and segment and higlights my different events during the day and how I am also trying 
to learn French on Duolingo. Now let's delve deep into what HTML elements I have 
covered today.
</p1>
    <h3>HTML elements I have covered so far.</h3>
    <p2>
    On this website so far we have the learned and implemented the basic HTML elements in the
site. wee have applied the header and body tags to the site, along withthe paragraph and 
other extra title tags to to make it become more <i>complete.</i> This are the elements that 
have been used so far :

<ul>
<li> HTML</li>
<li> Marque (The scrolling tag)</li> 
<li> Body</li>
<li> Paragraph</li>
<li> Unordered Lists</li>
<li> Ordered Lists</li>
<li> Underline</li>
<li> Sections</li>
</ul>

    So far today is probably the day I finished covering all of the basic parts of the HTML Language.
For Example, here is a good use of the anchor function that could be used to create links that 
attach for other websites. Here is a link for <a href = "https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-verse-of-the-day/">Bible Verses</a> 
you could look at. I also used it to create a tab like structure at the top that would have more 
options and versatility later down the road. I've also implemented an image tag to create a Logo
this diary blog. Now I want to test the audio capabilities of HTML with this audio:
</p3>

<p><audio src = "Flo Rida - Whistle [Official Video].mp3" controls type= "audio/mp3"></audio></p>
<p><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQdaUv95mR8"><img class = "lego" src = "https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/13/2015/11/docs-code-800x600.jpg" width = "200"></a></p>
<p4>
    You can listen to cool little audio i placed up there :). I also anchored a link to the basic HTML video 
i used to do a recap of all of the basic syntax I've forgotten over time. Below is a demo of me applying the 
table tag unto the website to simulate a to-do list of what I do on a regular everyday.
</p4>

<p>
<table border = "1">
    <tr>
    <th>Time</th>
    <th>Monday</th>
    <th>Tuesday</th>
    <th>Wednesday</th>
    <th>Thursday</th>
    <th>Friday</th>
    <th>Saturday</th>
    <th>Sunday</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> 7:00am - 8:00am</td>
        <td> Prayer & Exercise</td>
        <td> Prayer & Exercise</td>
        <td> Prayer & Exercise</td>
        <td> Prayer & Exercise</td>
        <td> Prayer & Exercise</td>
        <td> Prayer & Exercise</td>
        <td> Prayer & Exercise</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td> 8:00am - 9:00am</td>
    <td> Study and Bath</td>
    <td> Study and Bath</td>
    <td> Study and Bath</td>
    <td> Study and Bath</td>
    <td> Study and Bath</td>
    <td> Study and Bath</td>
    <td> Study and Bath</td>   
    </tr>
</table>

    I have also created a contact us page to test the structure of a User
Query Sytem.

    I know I have not put a lot of information in this page but i have 
 been using the Contact Us page to practice different CSS properties in 
 the form of buttons and etc. I am still watching  bit more on the video 
 and would implement some of the changes onto this page.
